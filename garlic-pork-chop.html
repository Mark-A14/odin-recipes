     <h1>Garlic Butter Pork Chops</h1>
     <img src="https://rasamalaysia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/garlic-butter-pork-chops-thumb.jpg" alt="garlic-butter-pork-chops-thumb">
     <p>In this recipe, you can use either boneless or bone-in pork chops. They typically take about the same amount of time to cook, so it's really up to personal preference or what's on sale at the grocery store this week. 

          You will want to pay attention to the thickness of the pork chop, though. Thicker pork chops will take longer to cook, but they won't dry out as easily as thinner pork chops can on the grill. So, thicker pork chops are usually recommended for grilling.</p>
     <h2>Ingridients Needed</h2>
     <ul>
          <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
          <li>2 2/3 tablespoons honey</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
          <li>2 clover garlic, crushed</li>
          <li>6(4 ounce) (1-inch think) pork chops</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
          <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
          <li>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze.</li>
          <li>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
     </ol>
